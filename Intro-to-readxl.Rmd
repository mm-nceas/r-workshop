# Learning `readxl`

We are working with data in readxl and it's going to be amazing

We are going to use packages:

- tidyverse
- readxl
- writeexl
- here


```{r package}
library(tidyverse)
library(readxl)
library(writexl)
library(here)

# install.packages ("package_name")

```
### Read in fish counts

```{r}
##### Read in the fish_counts_curated.csv
fish_counts <- read.csv(here("R-workshop-data", "fish_counts_curated.csv"))

```
